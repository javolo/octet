#INTRO TO PROGRAMMING: ASSIGNMENT ONE

To this first assignment the task was to hack the example of Invaders 2D Game that Andy provide us. 
I decided to start a new game from scratch re-using all possible code from the example give. For that
reason this are the step followed in the development of this first task:
	1. Background (including modification of windows_specific definition + removal of boders)
	2. Player (set player sprite, movement in the screen, collison with walls )
	3. Jump Effect (max_height jump, stop with border bottom)
	4. Never ending screen (Andy´s advice, two background images)
	5. Coins (including coin sprites, collision with player, score update)
	6. Read from CSV (using Andy´s code, searching on the net, problem with path)
	7. Different level of coins (interpreation of eol)
	8. Sounds (jump effect, taking coins)
	9. Problems found (removal of borders, position the score not following the camera, move border wit
	never ending screen, jump effect & border bottom space)
	10. Possible improvements (move the camera when the player is around the middle of the screen,
	include enemies, include boxes, include features to the map such as pipes or stairs, level random generator)
	11. Greetings (thanks to Raul (basics of games, matrix understanding, read from CSV and Andy (never ending screen, 
	jump space when touching the bottom border))

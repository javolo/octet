# 6. READ FROM CSV

One of the requirements was to read from a CSV file to input parameter, create a map or draw elements in the game. I decided
to use the file to create the level´s map of my game. For that I use the code Andy provided and also use the cplusplus forum
for further information.

I read coma by comma all the elements and I interpret them. At this early stage of the game, 0 means nothings, 1 means to draw
a coin. I also included different level of coins what brought a special treatment for the end of line characters solved finding 
an unusual lenght of String. Once found I updated the spacing variables to get the correct position.

One problem found was that the file wasn´t read properly. Searching different alternatives the issue was with the path forcing
me to put absolute path to the file in order to be read correctly.

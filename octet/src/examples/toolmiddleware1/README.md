# 6. READ FROM CSV

One of the requirements was to read from a CSV, text file or similar to input the parameters of the objects in order to create
them for the assignment. I decided to use an XML file to put in the game pitch the elements that will be affected by the constraints. 
For that reason I've used the code created for Intro to Programming first homework.

I read the element list (boxes, spheres and cylinders) that contains some important values like the position, the speed, the weigth 
needed in the different kind of constraints implemented in the assignment.
